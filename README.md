# GameServerRenewed
WIP

It all began when I created the first port (read: copy/paste). One day one of the original port developers came to our discord and asked why didn't I do it properly? Why did I just copy pasted? There could be so much stuff done better.

These words have haunted me for a few years, so this is my attempt at redeeming myself and trying to do it the right way.

This is nowhere near ready. It uses some fancy stuff I learned in the past few years so hopefuly I did better this time.
